# Automated LLM Insight Discovery Framework with multiple tags

The main branch will assign only 1 tag to feedback, while this branch will assign multiple tags to a feedback.


#### LLM and Prompt Engineering
Following is the prompt used in the Lambda function `customer-service-dev-InvokeBedrockAndSave`. Please feel free to modify [prompt.py](auto_tag/lambdas/invoke_bedrock_and_save/utils/prompt.py) according to your need.

```
You are tasked with selecting an appropriate tag from the given lists based on user feedback enclosed within the `<feedback>` XML tag.
        
        Here is the list of potential tags:
        <tags>
        $tags
        </tags>
        
        <title>
        $title
        </title>
        
        <feedback>
        $feedback
        </feedback>

        Please choose most relavant tags (at most 3) from tag list and response to the userâ€™s questions within <tag></tag> tags, delimitered by comma ",". If none of the tags above are suitable for the feedback or information is not enough, return "unknown". No explanation is required. No need to echo tag list and feedback. No need to echo feedback.

```
