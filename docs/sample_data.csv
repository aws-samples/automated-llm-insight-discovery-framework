Cloud Cam,Store_A,153,1,Cloud backup not working at all,"I've been trying to get the cloud backup feature to work for days now, but it simply won't function. I've followed all the instructions provided, but the camera fails to upload any footage to the cloud. I've tried resetting the camera, reinstalling the app, and even contacted customer support, but nothing seems to resolve the issue. It's extremely frustrating, especially since the cloud backup was one of the main reasons I purchased this camera. I feel like I've wasted my money on a product that doesn't deliver on its promises.",2/3/2024 10:15
Cloud Cam,Store_B,154,2,Intermittent cloud backup,"The cloud backup feature works sporadically, which is incredibly annoying. Sometimes it uploads the footage without any issues, but most of the time, it fails to initiate the backup process. When it does work, the upload speed is painfully slow, and it takes forever to backup even a short clip. I've tried troubleshooting the issue by ensuring a stable Wi-Fi connection and sufficient cloud storage space, but the problem persists. It's disappointing to have such an unreliable cloud backup feature on an otherwise decent camera.",5/3/2024 13:30
Cloud Cam,Store_C,155,1,Cloud backup stops unexpectedly,"I've encountered a recurring issue where the cloud backup process stops abruptly without any warning or error message. The camera will be in the middle of uploading footage, and suddenly, the progress bar freezes, and the backup never completes. This issue happens randomly, and I can't seem to find a pattern or a trigger. I've lost valuable footage due to this problem, and it defeats the purpose of having a cloud backup feature if it can't reliably store my recordings. I'm extremely disappointed with this camera's performance.",8/3/2024 16:45
Cloud Cam,Store_D,156,2,Backup fails to start,"I've been experiencing a frustrating issue where the cloud backup fails to start altogether. Whenever I try to initiate a backup manually or set up automatic backups, the camera shows an error message saying 'Backup failed to start'. I've ensured that the camera is connected to the internet and that there's enough space in my cloud storage account, but the issue persists. I've reached out to customer support, but their suggestions haven't helped resolve the problem. It's disheartening to have a camera with a dysfunctional cloud backup feature.",11/3/2024 9:20
Cloud Cam,Store_E,157,1,Cloud backup not accessible,"Although the camera seems to be backing up footage to the cloud successfully, I cannot access any of the backed-up files. Whenever I try to view the recordings through the app or the web interface, I get an error message saying 'Backup not found' or 'Unable to retrieve backup'. It's as if the backups are being stored somewhere inaccessible. I've tried reaching out to customer support, but they haven't been helpful in resolving the issue. It's extremely frustrating to have a cloud backup feature that doesn't allow me to view my own footage.",14/3/2024 12:05
